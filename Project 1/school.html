<h2>What Drives Me...</h2>    
    

<p>
Ever since I can remember, my family has always preached to me that only people that are already well off in life get to be succesful. When I was younger, that mentality always made me feel like they were right and I was destined to not do anything important or be someone in life. They believed that no matter how hard you worked, you wouldn't get far because people like us, people from our neighborhood, have a low ceiling. For the past few years, what has driven me the most was the desire to prove to them that working hard and not giving up, no matter how many times we may fall, no matter how many times we may fail, we <strong>CAN</strong> persevere and succeed in life as others do. In the near future, I plan on doing all I can to transfer to UC Berkeley, a school iv'e been dreaming for years about attending, to get one step closer at proving that <em>anything</em> is possible as long as we believe it is.
