<div class="rectools"><h2>Clipper Techniques</h2>
        <p>
        The Crown:
            <br>
            When trimming someone’s hair, be wary of their crown. When hair thinning occurs, the crown is one of the first places that starts to thin. By trimming the top of the head using one size, a thinning crown stands out more than it should. You can combat this by using a guard size <em>higher</em> when you’re going over the crown, for example, using a size 3 guard with a closed blade to trim the top and then switching over to a size 4 guard with a closed blade to trim the thinning area.
        </p>    
            <br>
        <p>    
        Skin Line:
            <br>
            When attempting to fade, it’s always easier to do so by creating layer guides so that you can fade section by section. You can start off your first line, often referred to as the “skin line,” by using your detailer to trim a line all around that starts right above ear level for what’s called a “mid fade.” The placement of the skin line can vary depending on how high or how low you want the fade to be. Everything below the skin line is going to be trimmed off to the lowest size or shaved off if that’s your preference.  
        </p>   
            <br>
        <p>    
        Guide Lines:
            <br>
            After the skin line, you can use your clippers to create the other guide lines. Every guide line after this one will be done using the following techniques. Starting with your clippers with no guard and an open blade, you will start from the bottom of your skin line and trim about a finger’s width all around the head to get that first layer. After this, you can go up and repeat the process using a size one guard on your clippers with an open blade, and again with a size 2 guard open blade. Do not go past temple level. 
        </p>   
            <br>
        <p>    
        Fading:
            <br>
            When you have defined guide lines, fading them is a little easier because you know where to fade and where to stop. The guide lines are made so that you know where to stop cutting with a certain size. For example from skin line to the no guard open blade, you will <strong>only</strong> use the clippers with no guard, open blade. To begin fading, you will go over that same section again but this time, closing the blades halfway. Once you’ve gone all the way around, you can close the blades completely and use a scooping motion on the skin line as if you’re trying to scoop it out. It’s important to note that when trimming with closed blades, to only attack the actual remaining skin line and not go up any further. The last thing you want to do is push the line up. You can repeat this process moving onto the next guide line with the next guard size.

<div class="rectools2"><h2>Shaving Tips</h2>
        <p>
            When using a shavette to shave arears or clean up edged, use warm water and shaving cream on the area you will be shaving so that it can go as smooth as possible.  

                <br>
                <br>

            Always remember to change your blade after every use to avoid using a dull blade that may tug at hairs or cut your skin. Shaving, if done right, should not be rough on your skin and the blade should be able to glide down as you shave. 

                <br>
                <br>

            Because the blades are so thin, they are razor sharp and can cut you at the slightest wrong movement when shaving. For this reason, never use a shavette in a way that will have you using the tool going horizontally instead of vertically.  

                <br>
                <br>

            Pulling your skin slightly upwards while shaving downwards can help you get a closer shave and makes it easier for the razor to slide down on your skin to avoid it from tugging the hairs.
