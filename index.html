        <p>
In 2020 during the pandemic lockdown, many people had to change the way they went about their usual routines. Of the many things that were affected, the one thing that I noticed people enjoying was cutting hair. Whether it was their own, or their family member’s hair, I saw people on social media having fun figuring out how to approach haircuts and after a while, I decided to join in on the fun and went on to find the tools I needed to get started.  
<br>
However, most of the tools I found online were far over my price range and I couldn’t justify spending an exorbitant amount of money on something I was just getting started with. That is why I am here to help guide you with tips and tools I recommend for anyone who wants to give haircutting a try without breaking the bank. 
        </p>

<p>
When cutting your own hair, it’s best to do with your back turned to a mirror while using a hand mirror with your free hand to be able to see the back and rear sides of your head you normally wouldn’t be able to see. This will help you keep a consistent trim all the way through to ensure you don’t leave any bulky patches.

    <div class="menu2"><h2>Cutting Someone Else's Hair <br>(Starting Tips)</h2>
<p>
If you are cutting a family member or friend’s hair, it’s best to do it in a well-lit area to make sure you have trimmed the hair evenly where you intended to. Indoor lighting outside of a bathroom can provide you a false lighting that <em>may</em> the haircut look complete but will have obvious bulk once seen in the proper light.
