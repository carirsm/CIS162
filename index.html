<h1>Oscar Perez</h1>    
    
<p id="body">I consider myself a <em>very</em> curious person. I love to learn new things, however, I used to have a bad habit of letting my mind wander sometimes. I would start to feel confident learning one subject and then think about how it correlates to another subject. Before I knew it, I would be juggling multiple subjects and trying to learn them all at once. Over time I have learned to pace myself and take my time learning as I go so that I can retain the information I take in rather than just memorize it temporarily.</p>
